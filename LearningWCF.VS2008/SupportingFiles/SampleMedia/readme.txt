This directory should have three files:
* Amsterdam.wav
* MovieStar.wav
* TheJimiHendrixTheory.wav

They are the songs I use for testing in the streaming lab from Chapter 3 of my book, Learning WCF. I put them in a separate download for the size, so please visit the site where you downloaded the code for my book, and download the separate LearningWCFMediaFiles.zip and put the extracted files in this directory.

You can optionally use your own media files...and edit the code to reference them accordingly, in place of mine.

These songs were provided courtesy of The Evil Doers, one of my brother's bands. He wrote and produced all the songs, plus he plays guitar and sings, so I felt compelled to share them with you :)
